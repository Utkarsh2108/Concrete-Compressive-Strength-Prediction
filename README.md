# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
## Project Overview
The quality of concrete is determined by its compressive strength, which is measured
using a conventional crushing test on a concrete cylinder. The strength of the concrete
is also a vital aspect in achieving the requisite longevity. It will take 28 days to test
strength, which is a long period. So, what will we do now? We can save a lot of time and
effort by using Data Science to estimate how much quantity of which raw material we
need for acceptable compressive strength.

### Dataset
- **Dataset Link:** [Concrete Compressive Strength Data Sett]([https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/72ptz43s9v/1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/concrete-compressive-strength-data-set))

### Approach
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.



### Technologies Used
- [**Machine Learning Technology scikt-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)

### Database
- SQL database or relational database is a collection of highly structured tables, wherein each row reflects a data entity, and every column defines a specific information field

### Cloud Platform
- Cloud platform Heroku is used for hosting the solution.

### Logging
- Python logging library is employed for logging every action performed by the code. finally logs are being saved in GitHub Repository [Logging](https://github.com/Utkarsh2108/Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction/tree/main/logs)
